notas = {exploding space space of prompting techniques and lightweight finetuning for adopting LMsa to new tasks (Kojima et. al 2022), eliciting sistematic reasoning..augmenting, tools. long strings of instructions and demonstrations that are hand
crafted through manual trial and error. and
closer to programming (composing modular operators to build text transformation graphs) where a
compiler automatically generates optimized LM invocation strategies and prompts from a program. declarative modules that carry natural-language typed signatures.t translates prompting techniques into
parameterized declarative modules. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior
of a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary
pipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric. a short declarative
spec that tells DSPy what a text transformation needs to do (e.g., “consume questions and return
answers”), rather than how a specific LM should be prompted to implement that behavior }

A recent work [Min et al., 2022b] even questioned the necessity of ground-truth inputoutput mapping: using incorrect labels in the examples only marginally lowers the performance. However, the
existing analysis of ICL is mainly based on standard classification and multi-choice datasets that only have simple
<input→output> mappings. We discover that those findings may not be applicable to the CoT prompting scenario with
more complex <input→rationale→output> mappings. For example, mistakes in either the <input→rationale> mapping
or the <rationale→output> mapping will lead to a dramatic performance drop (Appendix A.1).}

abstract = {In recent years, with the widespread attention of academia and industry on the application of large language models (LLMs) to code-related tasks, an increasing number of large code models (LCMs) have been proposed and corresponding evaluation benchmarks have continually emerged. Although existing evaluation benchmarks are helpful for comparing different LCMs, they may not reflect the performance of LCMs in various development scenarios. Specifically, they might evaluate model performance in only one type of scenario (e.g., code generation or code completion), whereas real development contexts are diverse and may involve multiple tasks such as code generation, code completion, API recommendation, and test function generation. Additionally, the questions may not originate from actual development practices, failing to capture the programming challenges faced by developers during the development process.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose Complex-CodeEval, a new benchmark for evaluating the performance of LCMs in various development scenarios. ComplexCodeEval includes 3,897 Java samples from 1,055 high-star GitHub repositories and 7,184 Python samples from 2,107 high-star repositories. Each function sample in ComplexCodeEval contains multiple annotations (e.g., function signatures, docstrings and reference APIs) to accommodate various downstream tasks. Furthermore, to better reflect diverse development scenarios, each function sample is required to originate from a repository that depends on at least one selected library (based on popularity), and each function sample must invoke at least one API from the selected library. Additionally, each function sample has multiple timestamps to avoid data leakage. Based on ComplexCodeEval, we evaluate the performance of ten LCMs across four tasks (i.e., code generation, code completion, API recommendation, and test case generation) to explore their performance in complex development environments. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the impact of context and data leakage on model performance. Our experimental results reveal several key findings. For instance, LCMs exhibit varying performance across different coding tasks. Additionally, rich contextual information can greatly enhance the performance of LCMs. Moreover, using leaked data for evaluation may lead to an overestimation of model performance, resulting in inaccurate evaluation outcomes that deviate from the performance in practice.},

nota = {unfaithfull on some tasks, Our experiments show large variation in the extent of post-hoc reasoning across tasks, and they provide evidence against the hypotheses that increased test-time compute or phrasing-encoded information are drivers of CoT improvement. We also see that the degree of post-hoc reasoning often shows inverse scaling, getting worse with increasingly capable models, suggesting that smaller models may be better to use if faithful reasoning is important. We hope that our metrics for evaluating CoT faithfulness open up avenues for increasing the faithfulness of CoT, building towards systems whose stated reasoning is trustworthy and verifiable.}

Decomposing a task into simpler tasks and solving these tasks to complete the original task has been an effective way (Zhou et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Press et al., 2022) to improve model performance on complex tasks. Several prompting methods have been successful in this regard. Our work STEP-BACK PROMPTING, in contrast, is on making the question more abstract and high-level, which is different from decomposition that is often a low-level breakdowns of the original question. For instance, a generic question for which employer did Steve Jobs work for in 1990? could be what is the employment history of Steve Jobs? While decomposition would lead to sub-questions such as What was Steve Jobs doing in 1990?, Was Steve Jobs employed in 1990? and If Steve Jobs was employed, who was his employer? Furthermore, abstract questions such as what is the employment history of Steve Jobs? are often generic in nature to have a many-to-one mapping since many questions (e.g. which employer did Steve Jobs work for in 1990? and which employer did Steve Jobs work for in 2000?) can have the same abstract question. This is in contrast to decomposition where there is often a one-to-many mapping since there are multiple decomposed sub-problems necessary to solve a given question.}

This implies that expecting these models to inherently recognize and rectify their reasoning mistakes is overly optimistic so far. In light of these findings, it is imperative for the community to approach the concept of self-correction with a discerning perspective, acknowledging its potential and recognizing its boundaries. By doing so, we can better equip the self-correction technique to address the limitations of LLMs and develop the next generation of LLMs with enhanced capabilities. In the following, we provide insights into scenarios where self-correction shows the potential strengths and offer guidelines on the experimental design of future self-correction techniques to ensure a fair comparison. Leveraging external feedback for correction. In this work, we demonstrate that current LLMs cannot improve their reasoning performance through intrinsic self-correction. Therefore, when valid external feedback is available, it is beneficial to leverage it properly to enhance model performance. For example, Chen et al. (2023b) show that LLMs can significantly improve their code generation performance through self-debugging by including code execution results in the feedback prompt to f ix issues in the predicted code. In particular, when the problem description clearly specifies the intended code execution behavior, e.g., with unit tests, the code executor serves as the perfect verifier to judge the correctness of predicted programs, while the error messages also provide informative feedback that guides the LLMs to improve their responses}

	abstract = {Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society. Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years. However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, realworld scenarios. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities. We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP, our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets. Results show substantial superiority of our CoTinspired prompting (553.3\%, 36.5\%, and 30.8\% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines. Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements.},

These vulnerabilities are often caused by simple, otherwise (and in other contexts) harmless code snippets (e.g., unchecked path traversal). Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to revolutionize not just human-machine interactions but various software engineering tasks as well, including the automatic repair of vulnerabilities. However, currently, it is hard to assess the performance, robustness, and reliability of these models as most of their evaluation has been done on small, synthetic examples. In our work, we systematically evaluate the automatic vulnerability fixing capabilities of GPT-4, a popular LLM, using a database of real-world Java vulnerabilities, Vul4J. We expect the model to provide fixes for vulnerable methods, which we evaluate manually and based on unit test results included in the Vul4J database. GPT-4 provided perfect fixes consistently for at least 12 out of the total 46 examined vulnerabilities, which could be applied as is. In an additional 5 cases, the provided textual instructions would help to fix the vulnerabilities in a practical scenario (despite the provided code being incorrect). Our findings, similar to others, also show that prompting has a significant effect. CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering → Software maintenance tools.},

	abstract = {We introduce Differential Performance Evaluation (DPE), a framework designed to reliably evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient code generation. Traditional coding benchmarks often fail to provide reliable insights into code efficiency, due to their reliance on simplistic test inputs and the absence of effective compound metrics. DPE addresses these issues by focusing on efficiency-demanding programming tasks and establishing an insightful compound metric for performance evaluation. DPE operates in two phases: To curate efficiency datasets, it selects efficiency-demanding tasks from existing coding benchmarks and generates computationally expensive inputs to stress the efficiency of LLM solutions. To assess the code efficiency, DPE profiles the new solution and compares it globally against a set of reference solutions that exhibit distinct efficiency levels, where the matched level defines its efficiency score. As a proof of concept, we use DPE to create EvalPerf, a benchmark with 121 performance-challenging coding tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation draws interesting findings on the efficiency impact of model sizes, instruction tuning, and prompting. For example, while the scaling law fails to account for code efficiency, general instruction tuning benefits both code correctness and efficiency. We also evaluate the evaluation by examining the effectiveness of DPE, showing that EvalPerf is reliable and convenient to use even across platforms.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like "Let's think step by step" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs with the "Let's think step by step" prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning tasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

	title = {Effectiveness of {Large} {Language} {Models} to {Generate} {Formally} {Verified} {C} code},
	abstract = {Within recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a significant increase in usage in various domains. One such domain is the field of safety-critical software, where the technology can generate code. However, code generated by these LLMs often contains mistakes and vulnerabilities, making it dangerous for systems where the failure can have severe consequences. In this thesis, we propose Vecogen. Vecogen uses LLMs to generate C code that is formally verified to ensure its correctness. The thesis touches on different parameters, models, prompting techniques and specifications as input for formally verified code generation. Additionally, feedback from a compiler GCC and a formal verification tool, Frama-C, attempts to improve non-verifying attempts iteratively, automated in a tool named Vecogen. Formal specifications in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL) and natural language specifications are used for the generation and improvement process. As these formal specifications also give different amounts of information, we curate two datasets. The first dataset contains formal specifications closely tied to a solution. The second dataset consists of formal specifications providing properties and equations to which a solution must adhere. For the first dataset, all 30 are solved using prompts, including formal specifications, while 24 are solved using natural language. LLMs can successfully translate the formal specifications into a solution if the formal specification explains an implementation. In the other dataset, natural language prompts perform better, solving 13 of 15 problems, while formal specifications solve 10. When the formal specification does not give direct information about a solution, natural language prompts are more helpful in generating code. The LLM often generates wrong code and code with signed overflows, syntax, and logic errors. Iterations help resolve these errors by prompting the LLM with the failed proof attempts and compiler output. Overall, LLMs show promise in generating formally verified C code for safety-critical applications.},

	abstract = {Since the success of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing machine learning and have initiated the so-called LLM prompting paradigm. In the era of LLMs, people train a single general-purpose LLM and provide the LLM with different prompts to perform different tasks. However, such empirical success largely lacks theoretical understanding. Here, we present the first theoretical study on the LLM prompting paradigm to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we show that prompting is in fact Turing-complete: there exists a finite-size Transformer such that for any computable function, there exists a corresponding prompt following which the Transformer computes the function. Furthermore, we show that even though we use only a single finite-size Transformer, it can still achieve nearly the same complexity bounds as that of the class of all unbounded-size Transformers. Overall, our result reveals that prompting can enable a single finite-size Transformer to be efficiently universal, which establishes a theoretical underpinning for prompt engineering in practice.},
